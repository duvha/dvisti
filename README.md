# dvisti
Dvisti (Двісті) is the Ukrainian word for 200 and this application is intended to be a free and open source editor for the Yamaha DX200 desktop control synthesizer. Although, initial development will concentrate on providing an editor for the classic 4-op DX21/27/100 FM series of synths based largely on and replacing the Unisynth editor. It is showing its age and is no longer able to be installed on Windows 10. The proposed software will be written in C++ using the Qt framework with the view that it will work on all the major OS's (Windows, macOS and Linux) with the potential that the software will even be able to compile and run comfortably on a Raspberry Pi. 

The idea is for a modular design and in time modules could be added for the veritable DX7 and the DX reface.
